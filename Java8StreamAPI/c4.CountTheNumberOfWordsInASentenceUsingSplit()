/* Write a Java 8 program to count the number of words in a sentence using split() *\

Hereâ€™s a Java 8 program to count the number of words in a sentence using split():

public class WordCount {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sentence = "Java 8 makes coding more fun and efficient";

        // Count words using split()
        long wordCount = Arrays.stream(sentence.split("\\s+")).count();

        System.out.println("Number of words: " + wordCount);
    }
}
Output:
Number of words: 8

Explanation:
sentence.split("\\s+"): Splits the sentence into an array of words based on one or more spaces.
Arrays.stream(): Converts the array into a stream.
count(): Counts the elements in the stream, i.e., the number of words.

------If you meant to exclude numbers like "8", you can filter them out:---------------

Exclude Numbers:

import java.util.Arrays;

public class WordCountExcludeNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sentence = "Java 8 makes coding more fun and efficient";

        // Count words excluding numbers
        long wordCount = Arrays.stream(sentence.split("\\s+"))
                               .filter(word -> !word.matches("\\d+")) // Exclude words that are only digits
                               .count();

        System.out.println("Number of words (excluding numbers): " + wordCount);
    }
}
Output:
Number of words (excluding numbers): 7


-----------------------------------------------------------(Without java 8)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


  
public class WordCountExcludeNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sentence  = "Java 8 makes coding more fun and efficient";

       String[] sentenceArray = sentence.split(" ");
        System.out.println("Number of words: " +sentenceArray.length);
    }
}
Output:
Number of words: 8

Exclude Numbers:

public class WordCountTraditional {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sentence = "Java 8 makes coding more fun and efficient";

        // Split the sentence into words using split()
        String[] words = sentence.split("\\s+");

        // Count the words
        int wordCount = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (!word.matches("\\d+")) { // Exclude numbers
                wordCount++;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("Number of words (excluding numbers): " + wordCount);
    }
}
Output:
Number of words (excluding numbers): 7

Explanation:
split("\\s+"): Splits the sentence into an array of words based on whitespace.
for loop: Iterates through the array of words.
!word.matches("\\d+"): Skips words that are purely numeric.
Increment wordCount only for valid words.
