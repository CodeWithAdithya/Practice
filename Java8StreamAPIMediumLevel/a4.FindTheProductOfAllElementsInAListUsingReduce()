/* Write a Java 8 program to find the product of all elements in a list using reduce() *\

import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class ProductUsingReduce {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);

        // Using reduce() to calculate the product
        int product = numbers.stream()
                             .reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b);

        System.out.println("Product of all elements: " + product);
    }
}
Output:
Product of all elements: 120

Explanation:
numbers.stream(): Converts the list into a stream.
reduce(1, (a, b) -> a * b):
1 is the identity value (starting point for multiplication).
(a, b) -> a * b is the lambda that multiplies two numbers (a is the accumulated result, b is the current element).
Result: The reduce() method returns the final product of all elements in the list.
