/* Write a program to print LCM and GCD of two numbers */

Greatest Common Divisor : 
It is the highest number that completely divides two or more numbers. It is abbreviated 
for GCD. It is also known as the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) and the Highest Common 
Factor (HCF). It is used to simplify the fractions.
Example: Find the GCF of 12 and 8.
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8
Common Factors: 1, 2, 4
Greatest Common Factor: 4
Hence, the GCF of 12 and 8 is 4.

Least Common Multiple : 
LCM stands for "Least Common Multiple." 
It is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by two or more given integers without leaving a remainder. 
In other words, it is the smallest common multiple of the numbers.
  Example :
12 X 1 = 12     8 X 1 = 8
12 X 2 = 24     8 X 2 = 16
12 X 3 = 36     8 X 3 = 24
12 X 4 = 48     8 X 4 = 32
12 X 5 = 60     8 X 5 = 40
12 X 6 = 72     8 X 6 = 48

  Therefore 24 is the least common multiple

public class JavaConqueror {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        int num1 = 12;
        int num2 = 8;
        System.out.println("gcd is " +gcd(num1,num2));
        System.out.println("lcm is " +lcm(num1,num2));
    }
    static int gcd(int num1, int num2)
    {
        int g = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <=num1 ; i++)
        {
            if (num1%i==0 && num2%i==0)
            {
                g = i;
            }
        }
        return g;
    }
    static int lcm(int num1, int num2)
    {
        int l = (num1*num2)/gcd(num1, num2);
        return l;
    }
}

Output : 

gcd is 4
lcm is 24
