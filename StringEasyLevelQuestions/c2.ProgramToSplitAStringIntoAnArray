/* Program to Split a String into an Array *\

public class SplitString {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "Java Programming Language";
        
        // Split the string by space
        String[] result = input.split(" "); // Split at spaces

        System.out.println("Original String: " + input);
        System.out.println("Split String into Array: ");
        for (String word : result) {
            System.out.println(word);
        }
    }
}
Output:
Original String: Java Programming Language
Split String into Array: 
Java
Programming
Language

Explanation:
The split(" ") method splits the string into an array wherever there is a space.
The result is an array of words that were separated by spaces in the original string.
