        System.out.println("String with first letter of each word in uppercase: " + result.toString().trim());
    }
}
Output:
String with first letter of each word in uppercase: Java Programming Language

Steps in the Code:
Input String: We start with a string: "java programming language".

Splitting the String into Words:

We use input.split(" ") to split the string into an array of words. The space " " is the delimiter.
After splitting, we get an array like this: ["java", "programming", "language"].
Processing Each Word:

For each word in the array:
The first character (word.charAt(0)) is converted to uppercase using Character.toUpperCase().
The rest of the characters (word.substring(1)) remain the same.
These parts are combined back using append() to form the modified word.
Building the Result:

All modified words are appended to a StringBuilder object (result), with a space added after each word.
After processing all words, StringBuilder holds: "Java Programming Language ".
Trimming the Extra Space:

We use result.toString().trim() to remove the trailing space at the end of the final string.
Example:
For the input string "java programming language", the program:

Splits it into: ["java", "programming", "language"]
Converts each word's first letter to uppercase:
"java" becomes "Java"
"programming" becomes "Programming"
"language" becomes "Language"
Combines the words into: "Java Programming Language"
