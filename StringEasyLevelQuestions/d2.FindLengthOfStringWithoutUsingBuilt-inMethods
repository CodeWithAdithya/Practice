/* Find Length of String Without Using Built-in Methods *\

public class StringLength {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "Java Programming";
        int length = 0;
        
        // Iterate through each character of the string
        for (int i = 0; i < input.charAt(i); i++) {
            length++;  // Increment length for each character
        }

        System.out.println("Length of the string: " + length);
    }
}
Output:
Length of the string: 17


Explanation:
We initialize a variable length to 0, which will keep track of the string length.
A for loop iterates through each character of the string. Each time a character is encountered, we increment the length variable by 1.
The loop stops when it reaches the end of the string, and length will hold the total number of characters in the string.
