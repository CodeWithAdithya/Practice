/* Write a program to check if the given number is Autobiographical Number or not */

Autobiographical Number:
A digit count numerically pr√©cises the frequency of digits 0 through 9 in the order in which 
they occur in a number. In other words, a number that is a pompous and self-centered figure 
whose only purpose in life is to describe itself.
We can define an autobiographical number formally as:
An autobiographical number is a number (N) such that the first digit of N counts how many 
zeroes are presented in N, the second digit counts how many ones are presented in N, the third 
digit counts how many twos are presented in N, and so on. Sometimes, it is also known as 
a curious number. It is the sequence OEIS A046043.
It is just like Self-describing primes that uses a different method OEIS A108810 to describe 
the Self-describing primes. The only difference between the two is that in autobiographical 
numbers digits are described in increasing order while self-describing primes digits can be 
described in any order.
There is only a number 10213223 that describes itself. We observe that the frequency of 0 is 
1, the frequency of 1 is 2, the frequency of 2 is 3, and the frequency of 3 is 2. 
Therefore, 10213223 is only a number that describes itself. The smallest autobiographical 
number is 1210.
Autobiographical Number Example
Suppose, we want to check the number 21200 is an autobiographical number or not.
First, find the sum of its digits (2+1+2+0+0) i.e. 5, and counts the number of digits of the given 
number i.e. 5. We observe that both are equal. Hence, the number 21200 is 
an autobiographical number.
Note: The method discussed above works only if the sum of digits is less than 10.
Let's take another number 1210. It has 1 zero, 2 ones, 1 two, and 0 threes. Hence, the number 
21200 is an autobiographical number.
The above method can be used for all numbers.
Some autobiographical numbers are: 1210, 2020, 21200, 3211000, 42101000, 521001000, 
6210001000.

Output:
2020 is an autobiographical number.
